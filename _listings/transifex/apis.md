description: Transifex is a Localization Automation Platform that powers the process
  of launching digital products and content into multiple languages. Built for companies
  with rapid development cycles, Transifexs SaaS platform lets developers store global
  content and create a continuous localization workflow. Through the Transifex API
  and Git-like command-line client, developers can ensure that new content is always
  translated, and the latest translations are included with each release. This means
  faster time-to-market, less strain on engineering, and a better user experience.
